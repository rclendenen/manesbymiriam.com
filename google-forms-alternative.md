# Google Forms Alternative - Guaranteed to Work

If Google Apps Script continues to have permission issues, here's a simple Google Forms solution that will work immediately:

## Step 1: Create Google Form

1. **Go to [forms.google.com](https://forms.google.com)**
2. **Create a new form**:
   - Title: "Newsletter Subscription"
   - Add one question: "Email Address" (Short answer, Required)
3. **Get the form URL**:
   - Click "Send" â†’ Link icon (ðŸ”—)
   - Copy the URL (looks like: `https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf.../viewform`)

## Step 2: Get the Response URL

1. **In your Google Form**, click "Responses" tab
2. **Click the green Google Sheets icon**
3. **Choose "Create a new spreadsheet"**
4. **Name it**: "Newsletter Subscribers"

## Step 3: Get the Form Response URL

1. **Right-click on the email question** in your form
2. **Select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element"**
3. **Look for**: `name="entry.XXXXXXXXXX"`
4. **Copy the number** after "entry." (e.g., `1234567890`)

## Step 4: Update Website

Once you have:
- Form URL: `https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/YOUR_FORM_ID/viewform`
- Entry ID: `entry.1234567890`

I'll update your website to use Google Forms instead of Apps Script.
