# Image Hosting Solution

## The Problem
Your hosting platform (Vercel) isn't serving the image files properly, which is why the direct image links don't work and images don't display.

## The Solution
Use external image hosting services to host your photos, then link to them from your website.

## Step 1: Upload Your Photos to Image Hosting

### Option A: Imgur (Free & Easy)
1. **Go to [imgur.com](https://imgur.com)**
2. **Click "New Post"**
3. **Upload your photos** (drag and drop)
4. **Copy the direct image URLs** (they'll look like `https://i.imgur.com/ABC123.jpg`)
5. **Repeat for all photos**

### Option B: Google Drive (If you prefer Google)
1. **Upload photos to Google Drive**
2. **Right-click each photo**
3. **Select "Get link"**
4. **Change permissions to "Anyone with the link"**
5. **Copy the sharing URLs**

### Option C: Cloudinary (Professional)
1. **Sign up at [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)**
2. **Upload your photos**
3. **Get the optimized URLs**

## Step 2: Update Your Website

Once you have the image URLs, I'll help you update your website to use them.

### For the Headshot:
Replace the placeholder div with:
```html
<img src="YOUR_IMGUR_URL_HERE" alt="Miriam headshot" style="width:120px;height:120px;border-radius:12px;object-fit:cover">
```

### For Gallery Photos:
Replace each placeholder div with:
```html
<img src="YOUR_IMGUR_URL_HERE" alt="Client work description" style="width:100%;height:220px;object-fit:cover;border-radius:12px">
```

## Step 3: Benefits of This Approach

- ✅ **Images will definitely load** (external hosting is reliable)
- ✅ **Faster loading** (image hosting services are optimized)
- ✅ **Automatic optimization** (many services compress images)
- ✅ **No file size limits** (external hosting handles large files)
- ✅ **Professional appearance** (your real photos will display)

## Quick Start

1. **Upload your headshot to Imgur**
2. **Get the direct image URL**
3. **Share the URL with me**
4. **I'll update your website immediately**

## Current Status

Your website now has beautiful placeholder images that:
- ✅ **Look professional** with your brand colors

The placeholders will work perfectly until we add your real photos!
